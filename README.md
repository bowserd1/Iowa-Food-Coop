# Customer Analysis: Predicting Sales to Each Iowa Food Coop Customer

The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted most businesses and the Iowa Food Cooperative (IFC) was no exception. Early during the pandemic, sales skyrocketed, and farms sold out of product as customers sought out different options to purchase food. As the pandemic progressed, many customers stopped shopping at the IFC and sales have gradually declined to levels near what they were before the pandemic. Seeing the need to increase sales, the IFC plans to conduct a marketing campaign to existing members. The purpose of this project is to predict how much every customer member will purchase during an ordering period so the IFC can target specific customers with their marketing campaign.

The IFC is located in Des Moines, IA and connects customers to local farms around the state of Iowa. As a cooperative, the IFC requires membership and operates on ordering cycles of 2 weeks. Customers order direct from farms. Every two weeks, those farms deliver produts to the IFC and the customers pick up their orders at a variety of pickup locations around central Iowa or opt for home delivery.

## 1. Data
The data for this project all came from the IFC's database, and I was able to access the database using SQL queries once I was given access to the database. Some of the sales data is available to be downloaded from the website in a csv file with the right access. I used both a csv download and data acquired from SQL queries for this project. The raw data is confidential.

## 2. Data Wrangling and Exploratory Analysis
