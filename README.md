# Iowa-Food-Coop
Customer Analysis-Predicting Sales by Customer

The Iowa Food Cooperative is located in Des Moines, IA and connects customers to local farms around the state of Iowa. As a cooperative, the IFC requires membership and operates on ordering cycles of 2 weeks. Customers order direct from farms. Every two weeks, those farms deliver produts to the IFC and the customers pick up their orders at a variety of pickup locations around central Iowa or opt for home delivery.

This project predicts how much each member will purchase during each ordering period. The data used is from the last two years of ordering by customers.
